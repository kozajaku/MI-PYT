Getting source codes
====================

You can download the **twitterjk** tool either by cloning from the `GitHub <https://github.com/kozajaku/MI-PYT>`_
repository or by downloading compressed archive from `testpypi <https://testpypi.python.org/pypi/twitterjk>`_.

Clonning from GitHub
--------------------

To clone sources from GitHub simply execute following command. This will create new `twitterjk` folder in the
current directory::

    git clone https://github.com/kozajaku/MI-PYT.git twitterjk

Downloading from testpypi
-------------------------

To obtain sources from Python testpypi you must first download the ``*.tar.gz`` archive from testpypi and then unpack it
using following bash command::

    tar xvzf twitterjk-*.tar.gz
